Same as question 5, execute the main method in “q8.py”, and the code itself will take care of calling right functions and doing multiple rounds of training. The output will be in “output_buffer.txt”. If necessary, change “output_buffer.txt” to “q8_output_raw.txt” and run “rawToCSV.py” by uncommenting the correct line and commenting the other lines in the main function. This will produce “q8_output_csv.csv”. Afterwards, the data in the “q8_charts.xlsx” will be updated automatically when choosing to bind data in the spreadsheet. If the data does not update automatically in the spreadsheet due to security warning, click on “Enable Content” on the right.
