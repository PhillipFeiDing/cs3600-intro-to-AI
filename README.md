# Introduction

This project consists of four parts which correspond to four programming assignments that I have completed or will complete throughout the course.

## Project I

### Search

- search.py
    - Depth First Search
    - Breadth First Search
    - Uniform Cost Search
    - A* Search
- searchAgents.py
    - Defining Corners Search Problem
    - Designing a Heuristic for Using A* in Corners Search Problem
    - Designing a Heuristic for Solving Eating All Dots Problem Using A*
    - Suboptimal Search to Eat All Dots by Greedy Method
    - Mini Contest: Approximate a Short Path to Eat All Dots

## Project II

### Markov Decision Process

#### Value Iteration & Q-learning

- valueIterationAgents.py
    - implementing value iteration algorithm to solve fully observable MDPs
- qlearningAgents.py
    - implementing q-learning algorithm to solve partially observable MDPs

*A large part of this project involves interactions of the agents in the grid world in which the actions they take are stochastic. Afterwards, the MDP model solved using q-learning is applied in the real pacman game to solve tiny maze problems with one ghost.*
